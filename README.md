# Overview

"cjx" gives you the kicks you need with the help of Coffeescript,
jQuery and XML.  It transforms XML to HTML and binds those
representations together, so you can edit the XML. "cjx" hits the
spot by doing this in an incredibly terse fashion.

# Warning

cjx is not yet ready for production use.  It may suit you nicely
in passwordâ€“protected environments where people are unlikely to
shoot themselves in the foot, but don't put your cjx applications
into the public or you might get kicked in the butt.  The problem
is the PHP scripts which didn't get no love.

# How it works

The functions that generate the HTML are called 'views'.  They
take their context information from global variables that are set
up temporarily with function with_mixin().  The views themselves
are also specified this way.  with_mixin() takes an array of
objects whose keys are the global variable names. For example:

```
  with_mixin
    foo: 1
    render_bar
```

sets the global variable foo to 1, calls function render_bar()
and restores foo afterwards.  Given that all views are already in
the global namespace you could render an XML document this way:

```
  with_mixin
    xml: ($ ".myxmldoc")
    render_record
```

If you wish to make the XML editable you can add the set of
editor views already prepared for you:

```
  with_mixin [
    V_EDIT
    xml: ($ ".myxmldoc") # Yeah. Get used to jQuery, dude! B)
  ], render_record
```

However, with this CMS' set of views it's not that super-simple.
It also takes a "schema" which describes the XML document, so you
get headings, labels and just the right views appropriate for
certain data types.  It's just the first view (render_record()
in this case) which you have to specify. Adding a schema is
pretty straightforward as well:

```
  with_mixin [
    V_EDIT
    schema: SCHEMAS["myxmldoc"]
    xml:    ($ ".myxmldoc")
  ], render_record
```


# Global mixins

## SCHEMAS

An object of all schemas used, keyed by name.


# Global mixins

This is a description of the global mixins used by the views.

## schema

The schema of the record(s) rendered.  It's an array of objects
that the describe the record's field.

```
    schema:  SCHEMAS["address"]
```

## parent

The parent XML element of the record(s) rendered.  New records
become children of this node.  For example:

```
    parent: xml_root "addresses"
```

## records

An array of XML records that render_records() is supposed to
display.  Requires 'schema' and 'parent'.  The most common
use case for it is:

```
    records: parent.children()
```

## schema_name

Used as a class name for the HTML elements containing a single record.

```
    schema_name: "address"
```

## desc

Actually provides the page or view title.

```
    desc: "Addresses"
```
